# Gurage Font Collection

A collectiono of Ethiopic fonts under the Gurage typeface preference as established
by Fekede Menuta, which was institutionally approved by the Gurage Zone Administration
Council in 2018, and was further refined by Wolkite University in 2019.

## The Collection
The collection is built upon fonts under the SIL [Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL) (OFL)
where changes and additions are made to support the orthography. The font names are
changed by simply prefixing "Gurage" to the original names. A single exception is
made for the "Gurage Zebidar" font whose name is inherited from a previous project.
Changes made can be found in the individual FONTLOG files in this repository.
