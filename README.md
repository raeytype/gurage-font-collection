# Gurage Font Collection
The collection is built upon fonts under the SIL [Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL) (OFL)
where changes and additions are made to support the orthography. The font names are
changed by simply prefixing "Gurage" to the original names. A single exception is
made for the "Gurage Zebidar" font whose name is inherited from a previous project.
Changes made can be found in the individual FONTLOG files in this repository.

## Modern Orthography
A collection of Ethiopic fonts under the Gurage typeface preference as established
by Fekede Menuta, and adopted by the Gurage Zone Tourism and Communication Bureau
in Hidar 2006EC (December 2013) and endorsed by the Gurage Zone Administration Council
in 2018.  The orthography has been deployed into the Gurage Zone public school system
at the start of the 2013EC school year (September 2020). The 28 letters introduced in
the new orthography have been adopted into Unicode 14.0.  The fonts in this
section use the applicable Unicode encoding in the Ethiopic Extended-B range.
